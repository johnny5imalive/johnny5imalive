- 👋 Hi, I’m @johnny5imalive
- 👀 I’m interested in computer programming I know a decent amount about hardware but it is the software I am wanting to work more with. The only coding experience I have is my space. I am 31 and am interested learning more about c++. Recently I went through one of the toughest moments in my entire life. Now I feel a new energy and awareness push in me to do what I love.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning absolutely nothing. This is why I am reaching out I have only moved furniture my entire having to drop out of school at 15 because my parents sadly were on drugs so I had to support my younger siblings and nephews.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on literally anything to do with spreading knowledge,love,and human kind awareness of the good energy we have in is all so we can change this world.
- 📫 How to reach me my email taylorjohnandleah@gmail.com first then if possibilities arise more info like phone # will be given. I look forward to this rabbit hole of fellow human learners.
